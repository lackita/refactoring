This is some sample code which will be refactored live at the CodeFu meeting on
3/7/2013.  It is a perl version of the sample refactoring from Chapter 1 of
Martin Fowler's book "Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code."

This is a program to calculate and print a statement of a customer's charges at
a video store.  The program is told which movies a customer rented and for how
long.  It then calculates the charges, which depend on how long the movie is
rented, and identifies the type of movie.  There are three kinds of movies:
regular children's, and new releases.  In addition to calculating charges, the
statement also computes frequent renter points, which vary depending on whether
the film is a new release.

Here is a diagram representing the interaction of classes:

|-----------|         |------------|          |-----------|
|   Movie   | 1       | Rental     | *        | Customer  |
|-----------|<--------|------------|<---------|-----------|
| PriceCode |       * | DaysRented |        1 | Statement |
|-----------|         |------------|          |-----------|

The workhorse method for this program is Customer::Statement, here is a diagram
representing the flow for that program:

      |-----------|                    |---------|    |--------|
      | aCustomer |                    | aRental |    | aMovie |
      |-----------|                    |---------|    |--------|
            |
----------->---                             |              |
 Statement |  |--------------|
           | ---             |              |              |
           | | |   *[for all rentals]
           | | |             |              |              |
           | | |<------------|
           | | |                            |              |
           | | | GetMovie
           | | |--------------------------->|              |
           | | |
           | | | GetPriceCode               |              |
           | | |------------------------------------------>
           | | |                            |              |
           | | | GetDaysRented
           | | |--------------------------->|              |
           | ---
           |  |                             |              |
           ----
